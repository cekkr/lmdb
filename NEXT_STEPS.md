- Promote the new profiling/eval metrics into a structured `var/eval_logs/*.json` feed so multiple runs can be compared without scraping stdout.
- Extend the MariaDB migration utility to support incremental upserts (avoid dropping tables) for faster roll-outs after nightly training.
- Evaluate the paraphraser thresholds on long, multi-turn prompts and add guard rails so corrective instructions are never rewritten.
- Add a `--metrics-export <path>` option to `train.py` that dumps the ROUGE/perplexity timeline for downstream dashboards.
