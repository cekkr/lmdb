- Rerun `make smoke-train` (or a trimmed variant) once a lighter validation slice is available so we can record the lexical / ROUGE / perplexity / quality baselines inside `studies/datasets.md`.
- Point `scripts/migrate_sqlite_to_mariadb.py --apply --incremental --dry-run` at the staging MariaDB instance to validate the rollback-only run before letting the nightly job push live data.
- Keep an eye on `var/eval_logs/quality_retrain_queue.jsonl`; once enough flagged samples accumulate, schedule a focused retraining pass that ingests only that queue so we can measure how quickly the quality gate drains.
