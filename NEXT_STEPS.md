- Run a dedicated smoke-train and inspect the generated `var/eval_logs/*.json` file to baseline the new lexical / ROUGE / perplexity averages for future alerts (capture the summary in `studies/datasets.md`).
- Dry-run `scripts/migrate_sqlite_to_mariadb.py --apply --incremental` against the staging MariaDB instance to confirm upserts leave existing tables untouched before wiring it into the nightly job.
- Collect a multi-turn paraphraser regression set (include corrective turns) so the new guard rails can be re-verified automatically after future pipeline tweaks.
